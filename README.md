Control two servo motors to move in opposite directions at the same time using Arduino.
# Dual Opposite Servo Control

This Arduino project controls two servo motors to move in opposite directions at the same time.

## How it works

- Servo 1 moves from 0째 to 90째.
- Servo 2 moves from 90째 to 0째 simultaneously.
- Then they reverse back to their original positions.
- The movement continues in a loop.

## Requirements

- Arduino Uno
- 2x Servo Motors
- External power supply (optional but recommended)
- Jumper wires and breadboard

## Purpose

This project is useful for creating mirrored mechanical movement in robotics, such as robotic arms or symmetrical mechanisms.
